## World Migration

The objective of the project was to learn the essentials of D3.js. You can see the GitHub Page at https://eponkratova.github.io/world-migration/.

### Why d3.js?
It is one of the easiest ways to create one-off custom visualization on the web.

From the official site: 'D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.'
